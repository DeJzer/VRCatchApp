# VRCatchApp
Script that I made to catch apps that are running in the background and send to VRChat OSC chatbox (only focused ones).

## Requirements 
- Python(https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.6/python-3.10.6-amd64.exe) **with pip installed!**
- Enabled OSC in VRChat

# How to use
## Installing
Open ``VRCatchApp.bat``. if you installed everything correctly script should work.

## Config
If you want to prevent script from catching some apps or maybe change text of them you need to specify in config `VRCatchApp/config.yaml`.

## FAQ

Damn, for what? If you have errors be sure you installed correct version of python and PIP by checking mark at the bottom when installing python.
